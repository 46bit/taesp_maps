<h2>4.4 Chronology and process</h2>


<p>In the absence of a documentary record, archaeological dating (see <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.

Despite these reservations, the results from Whittlewood seem illuminating. An original estate centred on <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.

The Lillingstones may have been divided around AD 975, the earliest date of abundant ceramics (see <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.

And on the same grounds, Akeley (see test pitting results from <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.

The closeness of these dates, given the problems of pinning down very precisely the periods of manufacture for many of the pottery fabrics on which they are based, provides scope for alternative readings of the evidence. Advocates of the <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#greatreplanning">'great replanning'</a> hypothesis might be convinced that this provides reasonable support for the total and rapid reorganisation of the social, administrative and economic landscape (Brown and Foard <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#brown98">1998</a>; Foard <em>et al.</em> <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#foard05">2005</a>). But equally, each of the new villagescapes may have been individually created with little regard for wider developments in the landscape, events that may have been separated from each other by as much as a century, in a process which finds closer analogy with the creation of the smaller <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#estates">estates</a> from which they emerged. </p>

<p>In favour of the piecemeal and evolutionary trajectory towards the creation of Whittlewood's settlements, and against a wholesale and revolutionary phase transition, can be placed other evidence. There is little to support the notion of large-scale centrifugal population movement, whether forced or undertaken voluntarily, which led to the abandonment of the earlier pattern of dispersed farmsteads, and the development of nucleated villages; although it may be noted that this did happen in some places such as Church End, Leckhampstead. Rather the principal settlements appear to have grown outwards as a result of internal growth from small <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#previllage">pre-village nuclei</a>, precipitated perhaps by some level of in-migration [<span class="view_map">View Interactive Map: Pre-village Nuclei and Settlement Trajectories</span>]. There is little to suggest that these new settlements were planned in their first phases. There is no evidence for tenements being laid out in regular rows along single streets or street grids. Nor are there signs that, when first established, the open fields which later surrounded these villages were laid out on a massive scale conforming to an overarching master plan (contra Hall <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#hall95">1995</a>). Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the newly created boundaries between individual territories, where they did not follow those inherited from the estate structure, may initially have been ill-defined and only formalised and fixed at a later date. This might explain, for example, the crenellated boundaries of Potterspury and Yardley Gobion, and Leckhampstead and Foscott which followed the headlands surrounding the <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#furlong">furlong</a>s of their respective open fields [<span class="view_map">View Interactive Map: Modern Parishes</span>]. Whatever the routes taken to the formation of the settlement territories of Whittlewood, by the <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window. ADS terms and conditions apply."  href="http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-458-1/dissemination/PDF/Reports/Historical_Reports/Documents/H_-_Documents_-_Domesday_Book.pdf">mid-11th century</a> the process was largely complete and individual settlements had already begun to respond in a variety of ways to their narrow horizons and the opportunities and limitations for resource management that these imposed (Teague and Sankaran <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#teague78">1978</a>; Thorn and Thorn <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#thorn79">1979</a>; Caldwell <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#caldwell78">1978</a>).</p>
