<h1>The Whittlewood GIS</h1>
   
<p>A substantial proportion of the data on which reconstructions of these villages' territories have been based is available to journal readers via a GIS. It is hoped that by providing access to this data, readers will be able to test the veracity of the conclusions outlined here as well as be encouraged to explore their own research agenda and to develop different readings of the evidence on which alternative models of medieval settlement and landscape change can be built.</p>

<p>You may explore the Whittlewood GIS in two ways, either via the main map presented in <a href="1.1.cfm#gis-map">section 1.1</a> or via the individual links to specific views found throughout the text. Readers are directed to the <a href="http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/ims/help.html" target="new">basic ArcIMS help page</a> which explains the GIS interface in a little more detail but also are pointed to the <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window. ADS terms and conditions apply."  href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/whittlewood_ahrb_2006/metadata.cfm">project metadata</a>, held in the <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/whittlewood_ahrb_2006/" target="archive">digital archive</a>, that will explain the shorthand codes necessariliy used in the GIS. The GIS also offers users the ability to view the data against the backdrop of the 1st Edition OS map for the area. 
Inernet Archaeology would like to thank the Landmark Information Group and Ordnance Survey for their permission to use this data in the article.
</p>

<p>Note that the GIS requires the use of pop-up windows. Please ensure these are enabled on your browser (for <em>intarch.ac.uk</em> <em>archaeologydataservice.ac.uk</em> and <em>ads.ahds.ac.uk</em> domains).</p>
