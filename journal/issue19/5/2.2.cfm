<p>Despite these changes, Whittlewood remains a landscape with high archaeological potential, and well documented too by virtue of its former status as a <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#royalforest">royal forest</a>, the administration of which generated its own records, and because both lay and ecclesiastical lords held land here (Pettit <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#pettit68">1968</a>; Elvey <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#elvey68">1968-75</a>; Salter <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#salter21">1921</a>; Salter <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#salter35">1935</a>). An interdisciplinary approach to its study has been taken. In terms of archaeology, old <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#coppice">coppice</a> banks have been mapped within the <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS.

Stretches of medieval <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#deerpark">deer park</a> pales also survive. Large areas of pasture have preserved elements of earlier field systems in the form of <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#ridgeandfurrow">ridge and furrow</a> (Figure 4), and also settlement <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS.

<p>Extensive and varied as the sources are, each remains individually incomplete. Documents have not survived; it has proved impossible to walk every available ploughed field systematically, to survey every earthwork or woodland [<span class="view_map">View Interactive Map: Archaeological Fieldwork</span>], to excavate within every village core, or to examine every building in detail. Nevertheless, over the five years that the area has been subject to intensive investigation, large quantities of <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.
