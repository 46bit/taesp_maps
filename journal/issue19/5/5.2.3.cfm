<p>By 1100 all the villagescapes of Whittlewood contained open fields. These were not extensive, but were well developed. A combination of factors appears to have combined to encourage farmers to return to manuring with household waste during the first half of the 12th century [<span class="view_map">View Interactive Map: 1100-1250</span>]. This can be seen as a response to diminishing soil fertility brought on by intensive and continuous cultivation, despite the regular fallowing and fallow grazing. This situation was made more acute by rising populations and their subsistence needs. Rising taxes and rents further demanded increased output. More crops were to be marketed, both to raise money for rents and to allow peasants to <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.

By the middle of the 13th century, heavy loads of domestic refuse were being applied across the arable zone [<span class="view_map">Interactive Map 16: 1250-1400</span>]. The acreage under the plough was also increased, as further <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#furlong">furlongs</a> were added beyond the old core at the expense of <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS.

This extension of the arable zone can be traced with accuracy through the pottery record within a number of Whittlewood's villagescapes, notably in <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS.

<p>In a parallel movement, other parts of the village territory were cleared and cultivated, although these remained outside the <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#openfield">open field</a> system.

<h3><a name="5.2.4"></a>5.2.4 Parallels</h3>

<p>The middle ages saw radical changes to the way that the arable zone was organised and managed. The introduction of <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#openfield">open field</a> farming was one of the most fundamental of all the changes to the villagescape. Much remains to be understood about the moment or longer process of transition from ring-fence farms to fields worked in common and how this was achieved. Whether the idea was welcomed by communities at large and enacted through consensus, or whether it was initially opposed and then finally imposed cannot be known. But there are sufficient grounds to suggest that the open fields of different villages might have originated from different stimuli and have developed at different times, and were almost certainly effected by different means. Individually the transition may have been swiftly achieved, but the transformation of the whole landscape may have taken as much as a couple of centuries. As such this chronology, its pace and its rhythm, resonates with that followed during the later enclosure of these fields, offering the possibility that a close analogy can be drawn between the two. </p>
