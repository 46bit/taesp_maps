<p>As population levels [see Historical reports, <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.

One option, as we have seen above, was to extend arable land, often taking in land remote from existing centres and thus difficult to work efficiently from them. Two basic solutions to the problem of accommodation thus presented themselves: to continue to extend existing settlement cores and to accept longer journeys to the outer parts of the fields, or to establish new settlements in previously unoccupied areas, effectively opening up a new front from which the less utilised peripheral parts of the territory could be brought into cultivation. However, both involved giving up economically valuable land. The extension of the village core, for example, often meant that settlement encroached upon former arable land (e.g. Oosthuizen <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#oosthuizen02">2002</a>). This might be offset by the addition of new <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#furlong">furlongs</a> at the edge of the open fields where space was still available for expansion. But this in turn usually meant reducing the area of pasture or woodland. Equally, arable might be surrendered for the development of a new settlement site located away from the original focus (Taylor <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#taylor95">1995</a>). But more commonly, these new satellite settlements began life as woodland <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#assart">assarts</a> of low or lesser value. As different communities resolved these issues in varying ways, the result was ever greater complexity in the nature of settlement. Where these once contained dispersed settlement patterns, these might coalesce to form <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#polyfocal">polyfocal</a> centres; where settlement had formerly been nucleated, this might fragment or, more correctly, proliferate, into more dispersed forms; equally, earlier patterns might be preserved. </p>

<h3><a name="5.3.2"></a>5.3.2 Trajectories and chronology</h3>

<p>This divergence is clearly seen in Whittlewood. It can be split into two separate phases, but since the dating on which this is based relies on pottery manufactured over long periods, this bipartite division, useful though it is, probably overemphasises these two moments, and underplays what was in reality a more complex on-going process. During the first phase, broadly dated to the 12th century, divergent policies leading to both increased dispersion and nucleation can be detected. Settlement proliferation [<span class="view_map">View Interactive Map: 1100-1250</span>] can be seen in Leckhampstead <!-- insert archive file when it becomes available [A - Test Pitting - Leckhampstead 2003] --> with the creation of a new node at Middle End, and in neighbouring Wick Hamon where the <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#hamlet">hamlet</a> of Elm Green grew up about one mile (1.5km) south of the village. Initially, <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window. ADS terms and conditions apply."  href="http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-458-1/dissemination/PDF/Reports/Historical_Reports/Notes/H_-_Notes_-_Dagnall_and_Elm_Green.pdf">Elm Green</a> lacked coherence, individual plots being widely spaced and only loosely articulated by a minor back lane leading to the main valley bottom road. Lacking design, some level of individual enterprise in the breaking of new ground might be postulated here. Settlement at West End <!-- insert archive file when it becomes available [A - Test Pitting - Silverstone 2003] --> in Silverstone was very different in nature, appearing to have been laid out around 1100 as a planned settlement with regular tenements, their curved boundaries suggesting that these were laid out over former arable strips, a settlement which shares much in common with Middle End. </p>

<p>At the same time, it is clear that all the principal settlements of the Whittlewood were growing. There is evidence for expansion around the core of Whittlebury (test pitting in <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.

Here the first phase of significant growth seems to have been largely unregulated, in contrast to places such as Wick Dive (test pitting in <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS.

As Akeley grew [<span class="view_map">View Interactive Map: 1250-1400</span>], so the two original foci around the church and the manor began to coalesce to form a single <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#polyfocal">polyfocal</a> centre, a process which may also have been taking place at Potterspury as settlement extended along the street linking the clustered centre around the church in the east to Blackwell End to the west.

<p>The second phase, dated by the appearance of <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#pottersburyware">Potterspury wares</a> to the mid-13th century, saw similarly variant trajectories followed within different villagescapes. New discrete settlements continued to form [Interactive Map 16: 1250-1400], such as a second satellite at Silverstone <!-- insert archive file when it becomes available [A - Test Pitting - Silverstone 2003] -->, Cattle End, bearing all the hallmarks of an assart settlement. As well as this more sizeable settlement cluster, this phase also saw a number of sizeable farmsteads established away from the main settlement centres, such as the submanor of <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS.

As with the first phase, this was a moment when further additions were appended to the principal village cores: at Whittlebury (test pitting in <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS.

And in <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.
