<p>By the 14th century, all the parishes of Whittlewood contained more than one settlement [<span class="view_map">View Interactive Map: 1250-1400</span>]. Their principal centres had grown into sizeable villages and, beyond these, <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#hamlet">hamlets</a> of up to a dozen households had developed, together with a rash of more recent large farmsteads, hunting lodges, mills and other <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS.

From perhaps as early as the 10th century then, with the initial growth of a few settlements around <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#previllage">pre-village nuclei</a> and the near contemporary laying out of the <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#openfield">open field</a> cores, the transformation of the countryside had largely progressed in a linear fashion: settlement grew, the number of settlements increased, arable expanded at the expense of woodland and pasture, and their territorial boundaries had become firmly established. </p>

<p>The first signs of <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window. ADS terms and conditions apply."  href="http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-458-1/dissemination/PDF/Reports/Archaeological_Historical_Reports/AH_-_Gazetteer_of_Settlement_Desertion.pdf">major reversal</a> to settlements appear during the first half of the 14th century, although some villages may have begun to suffer earlier. An exceptional local case was Wakefield, which seems to have been erased to make way for the royal hunting lodge and <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#lawn">lawn</a> which took its name and which lay at the heart of the forest, an extinction dated perhaps as early as the mid-12th century. There are signs also of decay at the edges of settlements such as Lamport in Stowe, indicating some shrinkage in the 13th century. But generally, settlements appear to have been robust, only slowly beginning to falter as a result of the late medieval economic crises and the arrival of the Black Death. Black Death accounted for not a single settlement desertion in Whittlewood, although figures indicate that the population here declined nearly by half, in line with national estimates (Benedictow <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#benedictow04">2004</a>). The result on settlement morphology, however, was significant. But how villages dealt with reversal in their fortunes appears as varied as how they had managed their rise [<span class="view_map">Interactive Map: Settlement etc. 1400</span>]. In places such as Akeley (test pitting in <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.

Shrinkage was most acute in the smaller settlements, such as the settlement clusters that made up <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.

But in places such as <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS. Link will open a new window.
