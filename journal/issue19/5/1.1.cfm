<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<h2>1.1 'Village Country' and the 'Land of Hamlets'</h2>

<p>By <em>c</em>.1300, compact or nucleated <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#village">villages</a> had become the dominant form of settlement across large parts of England. In particular they occupied a central swathe of countryside running from Somerset and Dorset in the south-west, through the Midlands, to Yorkshire and Northumbria in the north-east (Roberts and Wrathmell <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#roberts00">2000</a>). To the north and west, settlement was characterised by smaller <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#hamlet">hamlets</a> and individual farmsteads, while in the south-east a more mixed pattern had emerged, where villages, hamlets and farms successfully co-existed. How and why this regional variation came to develop, from what origins it sprang and when, all remain a matter of considerable debate (e.g. Lewis <em>et al.</em> <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#lewis97">1997</a>; Roberts and Wrathmell <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#roberts02">2002</a>; Taylor 2002; Williamson <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#williamson03">2003</a>). In part, the uncertainties that continue to surround the subject stem from an imbalance in scholarly approach. Villages have held a special fascination for historians, geographers and archaeologists for more than a century (Williamson <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#williamson03">2003</a>, 1-27 passim). Hamlets and farmsteads have received far less attention. Consequently, it has been 'village country', rather than the 'land of hamlets' (Maitland <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#maitland97">1897</a>) where most attention has been concentrated. This is a situation which is beginning to be redressed as more work is undertaken outside the so-called <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#centralprovince">Central Province</a> (e.g. Dyer <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#dyer02a">2002a</a>), and within it, as atypical or hybrid sub-regions have become the focus of detailed exploration (e.g. Brown and Taylor <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#brown89">1989</a>; Dyer <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#dyer02b">2002b</a>; Fox <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#fox00">2000</a>; Jones and Page <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#jones03">2003</a>; Taylor <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#taylor95">1995</a>).</p>

<p>Just as medieval settlement plans have continued to exert an influence upon modern forms, so earlier agricultural economies and variations of farming systems found within them have left indelible marks upon the wider landscape, lending it physical structure which has further emphasised regional variation. Observable differences in the shape, size, regularity or irregularity of fields, the presence or absence of woodland or whether it was disposed in large blocks or small isolated stands, together with the network of roads and tracks which linked these to the settlements from which the land was worked, form the basis of an alternative reading of the countryside, divided between the <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#planned">'planned'</a> and the <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#ancient">'ancient'</a> (Rackham <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#rackham86">1986</a>, 4-5). The geographical coincidence of areas defined by this method of categorisation and those areas exhibiting different settlement forms strongly suggests that the two were closely linked, either throughout or at least at critical stages of their development. Simple distinctions are easily identified, such as that which exists between the uplands, pastoralism and dispersed hamlets and farmsteads, and the lowlands with economies dominated by arable cultivation, and more nucleated settlement forms (e.g. Beverley Smith <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#beverley71">1971</a>). But inevitably such generalisations mask important local distinctions. In the English and Welsh lowlands, for example, <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#openfield">open field</a> farming was adopted by some medieval communities and not others; if the distribution of nucleated villages correlates closely with that of open fields, the latter might on occasion also be worked from more dispersed settlement patterns; and how the management of open fields might have many variants (Baker and Butlin <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#baker73">1973</a>). </p>

<p>The test bed [<span class="view_map">view Interactive Map</span>] for the ideas which are presented here is a block of countryside, 100km square in extent, straddling the county boundary between Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, lying deep within 'village country' (Lewis and Mitchell-Fox <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#lewis93">1993</a>).

The result was the division of the landscape into what we have termed villagescapes. </p>
