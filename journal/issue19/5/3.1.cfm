<p>	However defined, whatever element is examined, the settlements and landscapes of Whittlewood are now very different to those in existence around 1500. Over the last five hundred years, long periods of territorial and administrative stability have been punctuated by brief episodes of reorganisation. Of the twelve <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#parish">parishes</a> of the early 16th century into which our 100 square km of landscape had then been divided, only Akeley, Leckhampstead and Silverstone remain unaltered [<span class="view_map">View Interactive Map: Parishes 1500</span>]. Wicken, now one village and one parish was, at the end of the middle ages, split between the <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#manor">manors</a> and <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#parish">parishes</a> of Wick Hamon and Wick Dive. The process of unification began with the joining of the two manors in 1449 and was finally completed when the parishes were amalgamated in 1587 (Page and Jones <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#page04">2004</a>). Between 1832-44, the detached Oxfordshire <a title="Glossary entry" target="new" href="glossary.html#township">township</a> of Boycott in Stowe and the parish of Lillingstone Lovell were formally transferred to Buckinghamshire, causing localised changes in boundaries (<a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#vchb">VCH Bucks</a> iv., 191-2, 232). The territory of Lillingstone Dayrell was reduced, as its detached portion was removed and joined in the south to Lillingstone Lovell and in the north to Whittlebury, increasing their respective holdings and precipitating a small change in the line of the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire county boundary. In the south-east of the area, Potterspury acquired a detached part of Cosgrove in 1883, and the western half of the defunct Furtho between 1921 and 1951, and Passenham was split between Deanshanger and the new parish of Old Stratford between 1948 and 1951, the latter also acquiring the southern quarter of Furtho (<a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#vchn">VCH Northants</a> v., 127, 198).
