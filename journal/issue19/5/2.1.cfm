<p>The area chosen for study is unremarkable. Its gently undulating topography has been formed by the action of local streams feeding into the Rivers Tove and Great Ouse cutting through a thick cap of glacial boulder clay which overlies a solid limestone geology [<span class="view_map">View Interactive Map: Geology and Topography</span>]. Areas of meadow and pasture lie along the main valley bottoms [<span class="view_map">View Interactive Map: Virtual Tour</span>]. Above the flood plains, farms, measured in hundreds rather than thousands of hectares, combine the cultivation of cereals and legumes with the running of small flocks of sheep and herds of beef and dairy cattle. These farms are divided into hedged fields, averaging 10 hectares in size, which form the basic cropping unit and allow for the managed movement of stock (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Extensive areas of parkland surround the great houses of Stowe in the west and Wakefield Lodge in the north-east (Riley <a title="Bibliographic reference" href="biblio.html#riley01">2001</a>; OAU survey); upon the highest ground significant areas of ancient <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS.

'Whittlewood' is used hereafter as shorthand to refer to the study area and not to the whole of the forest, which at its greatest extent covered around 40,000 hectares (200,000 acres). Villages are evenly distributed across this landscape, from Whittlebury on the principal watershed to Passenham on the River Great Ouse. <a target="archive" title="Archive file hosted by ADS.

All contain some vernacular architecture of pre-1700 date, although levels of survival differ from place to place (Figure 2). The majority have maintained their medieval churches (Figure 3). Much of the housing stock, however, was replaced in the 18th and 19th centuries, and villages such as Akeley, Deanshanger, Potterspury and Silverstone experienced massive expansion during the 1950s with the construction of council houses, and during the 1970s with the laying out of large housing estates. More recent landscape changes have been brought about by the development of the airfield at Silverstone as a Grand Prix circuit, the establishment of a golf course at Whittlebury, the construction of the A43 bypass around Silverstone, and as a result of gravel extraction along the River Great Ouse. </p>
