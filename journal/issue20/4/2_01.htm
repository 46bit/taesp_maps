<h1>2.1 Landscapes of routine practice</h1>

<p>One of the most thought-provoking and widely discussed postprocessual approaches to be applied to the landscape is phenomenology (Tilley <a href="biblio.htm#tilley1994" title="Tilley, C. 1994 A Phenomenology of Landscape: places, paths and monuments. Oxford: Berg.">1994</a>; <a href="biblio.htm#tilley2004" title="Tilley, C. 2004 The Materiality of Stone: explorations in landscape phenomenology 1. Oxford: Berg.">2004</a>). Its assumption of the universality of the human body and its imposition of modern concepts of individuality onto past societies make a direct application problematic (Br&#252;ck <a href="biblio.htm#bruck1998" title="Br&#252;ck, J. 1998 'In the footsteps of the ancestors: a review of Christopher Tilley's A Phenomenology of Landscape: places, paths and monuments', Archaeological Review from Cambridge 15, 23-36.">1998</a>; <a href="biblio.htm#bruck2005" title="Br&#252;ck, J. 2005 'Experiencing the past? The development of a phenomenological archaeology in British prehistory', Archaeological Dialogues 12, 45-72.">2005</a>, 55). Besides, applying phenomenology to artefact scatters is, at best, a challenge (though it has been attempted: Given <a href="biblio.htm#given2004" title="Given, M. 2004 'From density counts to ideational landscapes: intensive survey, phenomenology and the Sydney Cyprus Survey Project' in E. Athanasopoullou and L. Wandsnider (eds) Mediterranean Archaeological Landscapes: current issues. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 165-82.">2004</a>).</p>
 
<p>Some recent work investigating technology in the light of practice theory seems more useful for the analysis of artefacts in the landscape. Technology is more than a series of practical operations linked by the laws of cause and effect. It is a physical experience of making and using material culture, in specific spatial and social situations. It involves constant interactions between people, material and landscape (Dobres <a href="biblio.htm#dobres2000" title="Dobres, M.-A. 2000 Technology and Social Agency: outlining a practice framework for archaeology. Oxford: Blackwell.">2000</a>, 126-8; Edmonds <a href="biblio.htm#edmonds1995" title="Edmonds, M. 1995 Stone Tools and Society: working stone in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain. London: B.T. Batsford.">1995</a>, 11-15). </p>

<p>The chaine op&#233;ratoire in particular is much more than a series of physical activities. The manufacture of a tool or a pot incorporates learned knowledge and an ever-widening social network (Dobres <a href="biblio.htm#dobres2000" title="Dobres, M.-A. 2000 Technology and Social Agency: outlining a practice framework for archaeology. Oxford: Blackwell.">2000</a>, 155; Hind <a href="biblio.htm#hind2004" title="Hind, D. 2004 'Where many paths meet: towards an integrated theory of landscape and technology' in A.M. Chadwick (ed.) Stories from the Landscape: archaeologies of inhabitation. Oxford: Archaeopress, British Archaeological Reports Int Ser 1238, 35-51.">2004</a>, 41). It looks back to the places where the material was quarried and where the activities and understanding were learnt. It looks forward to the places where the implement will be transported, used, reinterpreted and discarded (Stuart <a href="biblio.htm#stuart2003" title="Stuart, E. 2003 'Knowledge and practice: the Scottish Lithic Scatters Project and stone working in prehistory' in N. Moloney and M.J. Shott (eds) Lithic Analysis at the Millennium. London: Institute of Archaeology, University College London, 103-9.">2003</a>, 105). This web of connections constitutes the social context of an artefact scatter in its landscape. </p>

<p>This approach does not apply solely to the manufacture of tools. Routine, everyday practices are the medium in which people reproduce and transform the structure of their society (Bourdieu <a href="biblio.htm#bourdieu1977" title="Bourdieu, P. 1977 Outline of a Theory of Practice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.">1977</a>; Lightfoot <em>et al</em>. <a href="biblio.htm#lightfoot1998" title="Lightfoot, K.G., Martinez, A. and Schiff, A.M. 1998 'Daily practice and material culture in pluralistic social settings: an archaeological study of culture change and persistence from Fort Ross, California', American Antiquity 63, 199-222.">1998</a>; Silliman <a href="biblio.htm#silliman2001" title="Silliman, S.W. 2001 'Theoretical perspectives on labor and colonialism: reconsidering the California missions', Journal of Anthropological Archaeology 20, 379-407.">2001</a>). They do this in all the domestic and industrial activities whose traces lie in the ploughsoil or on a stable land surface. Cooking, storing, knapping, smelting, pouring: these activities are the stuff of human experience and social organisation. </p>

<p>Artefact distributions, then, provide a means of interpreting 'landscapes of routine practice'. People create and recreate their landscapes round them as they perform their daily activities and make decisions in specific social contexts (Hind <a href="biblio.htm#hind2004" title="Hind, D. 2004 'Where many paths meet: towards an integrated theory of landscape and technology' in A.M. Chadwick (ed.) Stories from the Landscape: archaeologies of inhabitation. Oxford: Archaeopress, British Archaeological Reports IS1238, 35-51.">2004</a>, 40). The artefacts that fieldwalkers count and collect are traces of the links between people, their predecessors and successors, and their material world (Br&#252;ck <a href="biblio.htm#bruck2005" title="Br&#252;ck, J. 2005 'Experiencing the past? The development of a phenomenological archaeology in British prehistory', Archaeological Dialogues 12, 45-72.">2005</a>, 62). They provide an entry into past 'taskscapes', arrays of related activities and, importantly, interactivities (Ingold <a href="biblio.htm#ingold1993" title="Ingold, T. 1993 'The temporality of the landscape', World Archaeology 25, 152-74.">1993</a>, 163; Van Hove <a href="biblio.htm#vanhove2004" title="Van Hove, D. 2004 'Time and experience: taskscapes within GIS', Internet Archaeology 16, (http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue16/vanhove_index.html).">2004</a>). </p>

<p>Settlement too can be usefully considered in the context of the landscape. A 'settlement' comprises the material aspects of occupation: the houses and communal facilities, the working areas and structures of a focus of population. The communities that occupy those structures are constituted by the daily practices and interactions of their members (Yaeger and Canuto <a href="biblio.htm#yaeger2000" title="Yaeger, J. and Canuto, M.A. 2000 'Introducing an archaeology of communities' in The Archaeology of Communities: a new world perspective. London: Routledge, 1-15.">2000</a>). These interactions range across the landscape far beyond the actual structures. </p>

<p>The landscape, then, becomes a 'community area', the arena for all those activities carried out in the course of the daily round: dwelling, sleeping, eating, making, cultivating, travelling. The same approach can be applied to a whole range of communities on different scales, including household, habitation area, or microregion (Kuna <a href="biblio.htm#kuna1991" title="Kuna, M. 1991 'The structuring of the prehistoric landscape', Antiquity 65, 332-47.">1991</a>). </p>

<p>These community areas are clearly not defined, bounded plots, despite the attempts of the GIS-inspired surveyor to draw lines round everything. They are fluid networks of routine movements. They carry connections with material culture, other places, earth and water, plant and animal, predecessors and successors (Edmonds <a href="biblio.htm#edmonds1999" title="Edmonds, M. 1999 Ancestral Geographies of the Neolithic: landscapes, monuments and memory. London: Routledge.">1999</a>, 20). All of these are performing together in the routine activities that make up the landscape. </p>


<p>The application of a theory of routine practice to real survey data is not, of course, straightforward. Artefact scatters are products of contemporary processes, not least the fieldwalking operation itself (Barrowman <a href="biblio.htm#barrowman2003" title="Barrowman, C. 2003 'Lithic scatters and dynamic archaeology' in N. Moloney and M.J. Shott (eds) Lithic Analysis at the Millennium. London: Institute of Archaeology, University College London, 99-102.">2003</a>). There is a wide range of geomorphological and other post-depositional processes to investigate, understand, and take into account while doing the interpreting (e.g. Bailey <a href="biblio.htm#bailey1999" title="Bailey, D.M. 1999 'Sebakh, sherds and survey', Egyptian Archaeology 85, 211-8.">1999</a>; Gerrard <a href="biblio.htm#gerrard1997" title="Gerrard, C. 1997 'Misplaced faith? Medieval pottery and fieldwalking', Medieval Ceramics 21, 61-72.">1997</a>, 70; Wells <a href="biblio.htm#wells2001" title="Wells, L.E. 2001 'A geomorphological approach to reconstructing archaeological settlement patterns based on surficial artifact distribution' in P. Goldberg, V. Holliday and C.R. Ferring (eds) Earth Sciences and Archaeology. New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum, 107-41.">2001</a>). A surface scatter can never have the same precision as the artefacts on the floor of an excavated house. </p>

<p>Even so, continuous survey can investigate the artefacts that were entwined within the activities, experiences and social relationships of past societies (Edmonds <a href="biblio.htm#edmonds1999" title="Edmonds, M. 1999 Ancestral Geographies of the Neolithic: landscapes, monuments and memory. London: Routledge.">1999</a>, 39-42; Edmonds <em>et al</em>. <a href="biblio.htm#edmondsevansgibson1999" title="Edmonds, M., Evans, C. and Gibson, D. 1999 'Assembly and collection - lithic complexes in the Cambridgeshire Fenlands', Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 65, 47-82.">1999</a>, 48; Given and Knapp <a href="biblio.htm#givenknapp2003" title="Given, M. and Knapp, A.B. 2003 The Sydney Cyprus Survey Project: social approaches to regional archaeological survey. Los Angeles: Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, University of California at Los Angeles, Monumenta Archaeologica 21.">2003</a>). To some extent, this is just the familiar search for the 'archaeological signatures' of 'assemblage-generating human activities' that lithics analysts have been doing for decades (Zvelebil <em>et al</em>. <a href="biblio.htm#zvelebil_1987" title="Zvelebil, M., Moore, J.A., Green, S.W. and Henson, D. 1987 'Regional survey and the analysis of lithic scatters: a case study from southeast Ireland' in P. Rowley-Conwy, M. Zvelebil and H.P. Blankholm (eds) Mesolithic Northwest Europe: recent trends. Sheffield: Department of Archaeology and Prehistory, University of Sheffield, 9-32.">1987</a>, 17). We can investigate variations in densities, function and material to detect the spatial arrangement of human activities and experiences, such as discarding, manufacturing and dwelling (Pollard <a href="biblio.htm#pollard1999" title="Pollard, J. 1999 'These places have their moments: thoughts on settlement practices in the British Neolithic' in J. Br&#252;ck and M. Goodman (eds) Making Places in the Prehistoric World: themes in settlement archaeology. London: UCL Press">1999</a>; Schofield <a href="biblio.htm#schofield1991" title="Schofield, A.J. 1991 'Artefact distributions as activity areas: examples from south-east Hampshire' in A.J. Schofield (ed.) Interpreting Artefact Scatters: contributions to ploughzone archaeology. Oxford: Oxbow, Oxbow Monograph 4, 117-28.">1991</a>). </p>

<p>One example is the manuring halo, the low-density scatter of pottery round a farm or estate that derives from household rubbish being discarded in the manure heap. This is now a familiar and well-discussed phenomenon, and has been confirmed by phosphates analysis and sub-surface investigation (Alcock <em>et al</em>. <a href="biblio.htm#alcockandcherry1994" title="Alcock, S.E., Cherry, J.F. and Davis, J.L. 1994 'Intensive survey, agricultural practice and the classical landscape of Greece' in I. Morris (ed.) Classical Greece: ancient histories and modern archaeologies. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 137-70.">1994</a>; Bintliff <a href="biblio.htm#bintliff2000" title="Bintliff, J.L. 2000 'Beyond dots on the map: future directions for surface artefact survey in Greece' in J.L. Bintliff, N. Venclova and M. Kuna (eds) The Future of Surface Artefact Survey in Europe. Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield Archaeological Monographs 13, 3-20.">2000</a>, 7; Crowther <a href="biblio.htm#crowther1983" title="Crowther, D. 1983 'Old land surfaces and modern ploughsoil: implications of recent work at Maxey, Cambs', Scottish Archaeological Review 2, 31-44.">1983</a>). A manuring scatter is not a post-depositional impediment to our analysis, but rather a direct demonstration of the routine caring for and 'feeding' of the earth. In Dobres' terms, this is evidence for a 'mindful community of practice' in a very specific social and landscape context (<a href="biblio.htm#dobres2000" title="Dobres, M.-A. 2000 Technology and Social Agency: outlining a practice framework for archaeology. Oxford: Blackwell.">2000</a>, 129). </p>
