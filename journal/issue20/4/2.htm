<h1>2 Continuous Survey and the Archaeology of Routine Practice</h1>
<p>Survey archaeology, it seems, has come of age. More and more of the 'New Wave' of intensive, systematic survey projects are now reaching publication. Even better, after some two decades of methodological strife, there is some agreement about the range of approaches that are appropriate in different landscapes and for different research aims (Alcock and Cherry <a href="biblio.htm#alcockandcherry2004" title="Alcock, S.E. and Cherry, J.F. 2004 'Introduction' in S.E. Alcock and J.F. Cherry (eds) Side-by-Side Survey: Comparative Regional Studies in the Mediterranean World. Oxford: Oxbow Books, 1-9.">2004</a>; Galaty <a href="biblio.htm#galaty2005" title="Galaty, M.L. 2005 'European regional studies: a coming of age?' Journal of Archaeological Research 13, 291-336.">2005</a>, 295; Mattingly <a href="biblio.htm#mattingly2000" title="Mattingly, D.J. 2000 'Methods of collection, recording and quantification' in R. Francovich, H. Patterson and G. Barker (eds) Extracting Meaning from Ploughsoil Assemblages. The archaeology of Mediterranean landscapes 5. Oxford: Oxbow Books, 5-15.">2000</a>). </p>

<p>Yet it is clear that the product of these labour-intensive and high-tech projects is all too often yet another scatter of dots on maps (Bintliff <a href="biblio.htm#bintliff2000" title="Bintliff, J.L. 2000 'Beyond dots on the map: future directions for surface artefact survey in Greece' in J.L. Bintliff, N. Venclova and M. Kuna (eds) The Future of Surface Artefact Survey in Europe. Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield Archaeological Monographs 13, 3-20.">2000</a>, 3; Cherry <a href="biblio.htm#cherry2003" title="Cherry, J.F. 2003 'Archaeology beyond the site: regional survey and its future' in J.K. Papadopoullos and R.M. Leventhal (eds) Theory and Practice in Mediterranean Archaeology: Old World and New World perspectives. Los Angeles: Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, University of California, Los Angeles, Cotsen Advanced Seminars 1, 137-59.">2003</a>, 147). What is worse, these dots are set out according to a modern Cartesian grid, whose 'God's eye view' denies any real viewpoint to a situated human viewer (Ingold <a href="biblio.htm#ingold1993" title="Ingold, T. 1993 'The temporality of the landscape', World Archaeology 25, 152-74.">1993</a>, 154-5). What use is geodesic quantification for understanding past human lives and people's experience of places? 'You can ask what a landscape is like, but not how much of it there is' (Hind <a href="biblio.htm#hind2004" title="Hind, D. 2004 'Where many paths meet: towards an integrated theory of landscape and technology' in A.M. Chadwick (ed.) Stories from the Landscape: archaeologies of inhabitation. Oxford: Archaeopress, British Archaeological Reports IS1238, 35-51.">2004</a>, 39). </p>

<p>The comparability of survey data at the regional level is clearly one major challenge facing the successors of the New Wave (Alcock and Cherry <a href="biblio.htm#alcockandcherry2004" title="Alcock, S.E. and Cherry, J.F. 2004 'Introduction' in S.E. Alcock and J.F. Cherry (eds) Side-by-Side Survey: Comparative Regional Studies in the Mediterranean World. Oxford: Oxbow Books, 1-9.">2004</a>). But even more pressing is the analysis of survey data in humanly meaningful terms, whether locally or regionally. Survey fieldwork is almost invariably a profoundly processual operation. It is replete with sampling strategies, statistical analyses, tables of data, and correlations between sites and natural resources. This is exacerbated by the power of GIS to produce showy maps which turn out to be descriptive and empiricist or else downright determinist (Blanton <a href="biblio.htm#blanton2001" title="Blanton, R.E. 2001 'Mediterranean myopia', Antiquity 75, 627-9.">2001</a>, 629; Cherry <a href="biblio.htm#cherry2003" title="Cherry, J.F. 2003 'Archaeology beyond the site: regional survey and its future' in J.K. Papadopoullos and R.M. Leventhal (eds) Theory and Practice in Mediterranean Archaeology: Old World and New World perspectives. Los Angeles: Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, University of California, Los Angeles, Cotsen Advanced Seminars 1, 137-59.">2003</a>, 147; Given <a href="biblio.htm#given2004" title="Given, M. 2004 'From density counts to ideational landscapes: intensive survey, phenomenology and the Sydney Cyprus Survey Project' in E. Athanasopoullou and L. Wandsnider (eds) Mediterranean Archaeological Landscapes: current issues. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 165-82.">2004</a>, 167-8). </p>

<p>This problem is not just specific to survey archaeology. It is even found in the landscape archaeology of the British Neolithic, which compared to Mediterranean survey archaeology has a high level of theoretical sophistication. For all the rich and innovative analyses of sacred landscape and monuments, the traces of mundane and everyday life just receive banal description (Edmonds <a href="biblio.htm#edmonds1999" title="Edmonds, M., 1999 Ancestral geographies of the Neolithic: landscapes, monuments and memory.  Routledge: London.">1999</a>, 8). Lithics scatters, to use the inevitable metaphor, end up being 'dots on maps', far removed from human lives and practices (Stuart <a href="biblio.htm#stuart2003" title="Stuart, E. 2003 'Knowledge and practice: the Scottish Lithic Scatters Project and stone working in prehistory' in N. Moloney and M.J. Shott (eds) Lithic Analysis at the Millennium. London: Institute of Archaeology, University College London, 103-9.">2003</a>, 104).</p>
