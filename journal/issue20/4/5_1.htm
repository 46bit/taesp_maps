<h1>5.1 Online or on paper?</h1>

<p>The advances in technology that make articles such as this one a possibility have added less to the presentation of survey data than might have been expected. Apart from the occasional inclusion of moving pictures and sound, essentially we still present our data in words, numbers and pictures. Whether publishing on paper or online, the primary aim is clear communication of the arguments and the data. Precisely because of the much wider potential and range of possibilities of online publication, these rules should, if anything, be applied more strictly than in print. With greater freedom comes greater responsibility.</p>


<p>Maps, diagrams and charts are highly sophisticated elements of a presentation (Tufte <a href="biblio.htm#tufte1983" title="Tufte, E.R. 1983 The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Cheshire, Connecticut: Graphics Press.">1983</a>, 181). They should not simply be used to show off the quantity of data collected, or to break the flow of a long section of text. It is perhaps their apparent simplicity that leads to abuses such as unnecessary decoration. This not only confuses the reader but can actually distort the data it was designed to present (Tufte <a href="biblio.htm#tufte1983" title="Tufte, E.R. 1983 The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Cheshire, Connecticut: Graphics Press.">1983</a>, 57-9).</p>


<p>Images and pictures present data just as much as words and diagrams, even though their content may be sparser. Drawings (sections, plans, artefacts) might easily be perceived as facsimiles of the original, but a level of interpretation is inevitable in their production. Even reconstruction drawings, most obviously interpretations, need to maintain a high level of data lest they become mere decoration (James <a href="biblio.htm#james1997" title="James, S. 1997 'Drawing inference: visual reconstruction in theory and practice' in B.L. Molyneaux (ed.) The Cultural Life of Images: Visual Representations in Archaeology. London: Routledge, 22-48.">1997</a>, 22-48). Photographs can contain data, though these too run the risk of being mere decoration. A <a href="panoramas/koutroullis.html" class="taespimage" target="image">panoramic photograph</a>, for example, can demonstrate the relationships between different localities, or evoke a sense of being in a landscape.</p>


<p>Whether they are being presented on the page or on a screen, the same basic questions of style, size and layout apply to these texts, graphics and images. With new and flexible methods of disseminating information, why is the format of presentation so often limited to linear texts with poorly integrated graphics? Why should texts and figure lists be so determinedly linear? Why should illustrations be incorporated with the text as if the two elements still required very different printing techniques, when more multifaceted, integrated and interactive approaches are now possible?</p>


<p>There is now good evidence that when different types of information are presented together and integrated, the reader has a much improved understanding of both map and text (Schwartz <em>et al</em>. <a href="biblio.htm#schwartz1998" title="Schwartz, N.H., Ellsworth, L.S., Graham, L. and Knight, B. 1998 'Accessing prior knowledge to remember text: a comparison of advance organizers and maps', Contemporary Educational Psychology 23, 65-89.">1998</a>, 87). Even with the establishment of <em>Internet Archaeology</em>, however, only a few archaeological authors have chosen to take this path (e.g. Holtorf <a href="biblio.htm#holtorf1999" title="Holtorf, C.J. 1999 'Is History going to be on my side? On the experience of writing and submitting a hypermedia PhD thesis', Internet Archaeology 6, (http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue6/holtorf_toc.html).">1999</a>; Huggett and Guo-Yuan <a href="biblio.htm#huggettgou-yuan2000" title="Huggett, J. and Guo-Yuan, C. 2000 '3D interpretative modelling of archaeological sites/A computer reconstruction of a medieval timber and earthwork castle', Internet Archaeology 8, (http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue8/huggett_index.html).">2000</a>). </p>


<p>The close integration of complementary data in an article or report has always been difficult with traditional methods of presentation. The best that can be achieved in a single volume is a comprehensive set of appendices. In an online article such as this one, the appendices can be replaced by the complete project database, allowing the integration of detailed field data on demand. The reader can drill down from the article on screen directly into the project archive. A paper book, for all its ease of browsing and appealing materiality, could never achieve such interactivity and integration.</p>
