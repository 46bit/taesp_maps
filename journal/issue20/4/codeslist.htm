<h2><a name="erosion"></a>Erosion</h2>
<p>Erosion is the process by which surface materials (artefacts, organic matter, soil, sediment, rock) are dislodged, transported and removed through the agency of water moving across a surface.  Water flows as sheets or concentrated in, with increasing size and discharge, rills, gullies, streams, and rivers).  This category focuses on the process of surface deflation (erosion) or inflation (deposition), and is distinguished by categories of natural or cultural origin. Erosion by impact of rain drops (rain splash) is
included here.

<h2>Land Use</h2>
<p>General associations of vegetation, crops and/or structures are noted as they are for the current survey year.  Definite identification of land use may require consideration of what crops were grown and harvested during the past year. For example a freshly ploughed field may show signs of cereal grain crops, so 'Gr' is noted rather than 'Cu,' which is reserved for uncertain or unmatched conditions.

<a name="morph"></a>
<h2>Morphostratigraphy</h2>
<p>Morphostratigraphic units are the basic geomorphological mapping unit comprised of a landform with or without underlying earth materials. This is a map unit which is recognizable in imagery and in the field, has an extent appropriate to the scale of the investigation, and has internal variability which is described, encoded and related in another manner (stratigraphic description, soil description, and their analyses). Alluvium is a sediment deposited by flowing water either in a channel or on a broad plain.  Alluvial refers to the process of transporting and depositing alluvium (syn. Fluvial). Colluvium is a sediment deposited by gravity and/or sheets of surface water  (other than channelised flow - see alluvium).
Typically on hillslopes.

<a name="soilcarb"></a>
<h2>Soil Carbonate</h2>
<p>Soils in Cyprus accumulate calcium carbonate with time, from none (Ka) to completely engulfed (K46).  Except for the mountainous core of the Troodos, Cypriot soils are generally considered calcareous. The accumulation of carbonate results in a progression of recognisable morphologies in profile.  Older soils have massive accumulations that cement the soil together into what some refer to as caliche, a defunct term. The categories set here are based on the six categories commonly used by soil scientists in the arid regions of the world.  A separate comparator chart is used to determine these categories.

<a name="soilcov"></a>
<h2>Soil Cover</h2>

<p>Microphytic crust develops on the surface of soil under various conditions. The ground-covering, low-lying biota are inextricably attached to the soil, forming a mm to cm thick crust that detaches with ease from the underlying soil.  The crust is coherent enough that it does not fully crumble away after extraction from the surface.</p>

<h2>Soil Texture</h2>
<p>Soil texture is determined on the basis of feel and visual inspection. The fine earth fraction, or texture, is an estimate of the relative amounts of sand, silt and clay (all &lt;2 mm mean diameter) in the surface soil horizon. Chart provided to determine this.</p>

<a name="subst"></a>
<h2>Substratum</h2>

<p>Substratum is designate for the earth material underlying the geomorphological unit, in general, and the morphostratigraphic unit, in particular. Bedrock formation name is used in this field unless bedrock is (1) not visible at the surface and (2) more than 1 meter below the surface (as seen in gullies, excavations, etc.). In these cases use the appropriate alluvial or colluvial morphostratigraphic code/term (see above) in this field on the GU form. Bedrock is the hard, consolidated rock underlying the sediment cover.  Typically rings if struck by a hammer (see below).  Two general types of bedrock are recognized in central Cyprus: the Troodos Ophiolite and overlying sedimentary rocks of the Mesaoria.</p>

<tr><th>Code</th><th>Term</th><th>Definition</th></tr>
<tr><td><a name="Bo"></a>Bo</td><td>Ophiolite rocks</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="Bob"></a>Bob </td><td>Basal group</td><td>Complex rock types, visibly crystalline. Formed beneath the Sheeted Dike Complex, and thus present in the central Troodos.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="Bod"></a>Bod</td><td>Sheeted dike</td><td>A sequence of planar layers of igneous rock that were intruded into older (Lower Pillow Lava) rocks. Generally dikes are intrusions emplaced at high angles or vertically, while the term sill is reserved for horizontal intrusions.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="Bop"></a>Bop</td><td>Pillow basalt</td><td>A basaltic rock that was extruded below the sea floor. As the basalt erupts it forms long tubes, which cooled and hardened on the
outside allowing hot lava to continue flowing on the inside. These tubes flow out over each other to form the primary sea floor basalts at mid-ocean ridges. When the pillow lavas are brought
above ocean level and exposed via erosion they typically are observed to be round pillow-shaped units in cross section, thus the term pillow lavas. The Pillow Lavas on Cyprus are subdivided into
the Upper and Lower Pillow Lavas, the former hosting the copper and gold ore bodies at the top of the Ophiolite below the sedimentary rocks.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a name="Buc"></a>Buc</td><td>Chert</td><td>A siliceous sedimentary rock, formed on the seafloor, that rings when hammer struck; does not fizz. Has been extensively utilized for lithic tool manufacture.</td></tr>

grained matrix.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="Buk"></a>Buk</td><td>Unknown</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="Bul"></a>Bul</td><td>Limestone </td><td>A sedimentary rock comprised dominantly of calcium carbonate; should fizz when tested with hydrochloric acid. In comparison with a chalk or marl, limestone is hard and should ring when struck with a hammer.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="Bum"></a>Bum</td><td>Marl</td><td>A soft, earthy, fine textured limestone that may include up to 50% non-calcareous clay. Should fizz when tested with hydrochloric</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="Bus"></a>Bus</td><td>Sandstone</td><td>Sedimentary rock composed of particles 1/16 to 2 mm in diameter. Individual sand grains are generally visible to the naked eye and are rough and abrasive when rubbed between the fingers; sand is cemented into rock.</td></tr>

<a name="surfstab"></a>
<h2>Surface Stability</h2>
<p>Stability of the landscape is particularly important for the assessment of the surface archaeological record, is characterized in terms of the degree of preservation of the surface soil horizons that presumably were there at the time of the deposition of the artefacts.  This schema does not allow for the case where the A horizon is eroded prior to the deposition of artefacts.  The reference time frame is the year 2000, unless otherwise noted.</p>

<tr><th>Code</th><th>Term</th><th>Definition</th></tr>

<tr><td><a name="Stable"></a>Stable</td><td>A Horizon intact</td><td>Soil has an organic-rich crust (root mat; microphytic crust of moss, lichen and herbaceous plants) and/or an A horizon of greater than 1 cm thickness. The A horizon is defined by the presence of roots and other plant matter within a horizon, which is at least faintly darker in Munsell colour value (&gt;1 ), is still intact, although it may be reduced in thickness.</td></tr>
